# Lesson 2 notes

- Client code
- A method from a class can override a method of the same name from a superclass that the class inherits from. Howver **overriding** is generally treated as an aspect of inheritance therefore this is polymorphism through inheritance.

## Approach to OOP

The classical approach to object oriented programming is:

Write a textual description of the problem or exercise.
Extract the major nouns and verbs from the description.
Organize and associate the verbs with the nouns.
The nouns are the classes and the verbs are the behaviors or methods.
